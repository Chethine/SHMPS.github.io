                  diseases and condition of their health without showing test results to a doctor .So that expenses
                  can be saved due to our system.

                  <br />

                  Health Management and Prediction System, abbreviated as HMPS. This system serves four
                  important functions. They are able to identify and make predictions regarding chronic diseases
                  when medical data or health reports are presented in the form of photos. Determine what the
                  patient's most significant problem is. If the answer is yes, show some of the best doctors in your
                  region, In the event that the patient's condition is considered to be life-threatening, hospitals and
                  pharmacies should be provided. Compute the individual medical expenses that will be invoiced
                  to the user's health insurance based on their day-to-day activities.

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  The system gives users the ability to input medical reports in the form of images. Then system
                  gathers the relevant and important data in order to determine the current health status of the
                  patient using parameters such as based on the liquor consumption, physical activities, smoking,
                  and inheriting a predisposition to the disease. This is accomplished through a machine learning
                  model that uses a linear regression model. Image processing will be used to extract the data from
                  the medical reports, RP team will get the data in order to analyze them for illness diagnosis.
                  When putting the model into action, you will be responsible for data collection, training of the
                  model, and assessment of the model.

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  A component of image processing collected data on the prediction of diabetes. Next job is to
                  find the most effective algorithm for predicting diabetes and heart diseases by making use of
                  those data and achieving a high rate of accuracy. RP team will make use of the Support vector
                  machine for predict diabetes and logistic regression model to predict heart diseases in order to
                  obtain results that are more accurate. Patients are categorized within the system according to
                  their state, and the system also decides whether or not the patient's condition is life-threatening.
                  After that, the system does an analysis on the data that was entered and provides a percentage of
                  healthy levels along with recommendations and shows doctors, medical centers, pharmacies and
                  hospitals according to the location of the user.

                  <br />
                  <br />

                  Rp team will choose right machine learning model that, based on the datasets, can provide the
                  most accurate prediction of the total cost of medical care. Using linear regression model for
                  logistic regression, train the model by utilizing those data sets, and then validate the model to
                  ensure that it is accurate and estimate individual health insurance-billed medical expenditures

                According to the research gap in the study of health diseases, there are some gaps between the
                current systems and the systems being implemented. One of the major parts of this study area is
                providing datasets of patients suffering from those diseases. that can normally be focused on the
                performance of the system. There are some models that have to specify the affected heart disease
                and the accuracy of predicting the disease. Decision trees and support vector machines can be
                demonstrated as tools for identifying heart diseases. There are a large number of patients suffering
                from heart disease, and the risk can be high. there is more than affected heart disease patients but
                type two heart prediction research can be rarely. It can be necessary to do research about the
                important missing values. There is a need to use the correct data set to train the models and identify
                diseases. On the other hand, factors that cause heart disease in patients will affect the supply. It
                can be difficult to identify the disease with current models. In current systems, it is possible to
                predict heart disease with the proper details. System implementation can identify the blood
                pressure level and give accurate input to identify an accurate model that needs to predict heart
                disease. it can be determine patient to closest hospitals and pharmersis to predict the risk. Such
                improved features are not available in the current systems.


                <br />
                <br />

                A significant research gap in the field of study has been found by the research team.Most of the
                existing studies have focused on optimizing performance on a particular dataset, leading to
                overfitting and poor generalization capability. A large number of research use oversimplified models, such as linear regression or decision
                trees, which do not represent the complexities of the interactions between the factors that put
                people at risk for diabetes. There is a limited amount of data accessible for research, particularly with regard to type 1
                diabetes, despite the rising prevalence of diabetes. This is notably the case. The data that are
                currently available frequently have problems with missing values, noise, and imbalance. So RP
                team have to collect more data sets for train models with correct data.
                Because the majority of the existing models lack interpretability, it is difficult for healthcare
                providers to comprehend the factors that contribute to an increased risk of developing diabetes.
                In exiting systems there is only predictions some systems are trying to predict without getting
                glucose level in this research RP team trying to predict with using most accurate input data and
                get a accurate prediction after that user can view nearby doctors and get personal
                recommendations .In current systems this feature is not available.


                <br />
                <br />

                The research team has identified a significant research gap in the area of study. Major risk factors
                for diabetes and heart disease include heavy alcohol and tobacco consumption, lack of physical
                activity, and the existence of the disease in one's parents. Nevertheless, the problem with existing
                studies and systems is that they do not take these aspects into account when predicting disease.
                In addition, the research team has determined that existing systems do not assess the criticality of
                the disease. These systems solely predict diseases and do not provide patients with any sort of
                recommendation. Current systems do not provide adequate privacy and confidentiality for medical records. People
                are increasingly concerned about the privacy of personal data, and there are rules such as HIPPA
                in place to protect the confidentiality of health records. The system's lack of privacy and
                confidentiality may discourage people from utilizing it.


                <br />
                <br />

                Even though there have been several attempts to make secure health management and prediction
                systems for chronic diseases, there is still a big research gap in this area. One of the biggest
                problems is that these systems have not been tested and used in real life. Most of the research
                that has already been done in this area has focused on making and testing machine learning
                algorithms that can predict how a disease will progress. But these algorithms need to be tested in
                real-world settings and their ability to improve patient outcomes needs to be evaluated. Lack of
                focus on patient engagement and user experience is another research hole in this area. It is
                important to create machine learning algorithms, but it is just as important to make sure that
                patients are willing and able to use the system. The system's usability, user-friendliness, and
                ability to be accessed by patients from different backgrounds and demographics are key to its
                adoption and success. So, there needs to be user testing and an assessment of how well the
                system works for patients

                <br />
                <br />

                Data interoperability and standardization are also problems that need to be solved. Chronic
                diseases require the collection and analysis of different types of health data, like vital signs,
                medication adherence, lifestyle factors, LIPID profiles, Full blood count reports and medical
                history. But these data are often stored in different formats and systems, which makes it hard to
                combine them onto a single platform. So, standards and protocols for data interoperability need
                to be made so that the system can effectively collect, analyze, and present patient data. Lastly,
                there's the problem of keeping patient data private and safe. Existing research in this area has
                emphasized the need for secure data storage and access control mechanisms, but new solutions
                are needed to reduce the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access. For example, the system
                could use blockchain technology to make sure that patient data is secure and can't be changed.


                <br />
                <br />

                In conclusion, there is a big research gap when it comes to making and using secure systems for
                health management and disease prediction for chronic diseases. To fill these gaps, we need to do
                real-world implementation and evaluation, put patient engagement and user experience first,
                create data interoperability standards, and look for new ways to protect privacy and security.

                When they become a global problem, chronic diseases can be major parts of their patients' lives.
                The majority of patients died from the chronic disease because of some major illness that caused
                their deaths. It can be cured to a certain extent by treatment with the knowledge of a doctor after
                the disease is diagnosed in the first place. Diabetes and heart disease can be serious types of
                diseases that may be inactive for their whole lives. This can be the reason why people's bad
                behaviors become unhealthy. According to the past few years of the WHO, a huge number of
                patients have increased due to diabetes and heart disease. Between 2000 and 2019, the number of
                patients increased by 3 percent. In the united state there are one in five Americans are suffering
                from the diabetes and some of people eight in ten are suffering from the pre diabetic it may
                caused to the unaware from a cause of early death getting than their life’s. The fact that prompt
                and adequate care can successfully treat these disorders is the single most essential characteristic
                of these conditions.
                Due to a shortage of doctors, many people are suffering due to difficulties in treatment in some
                districts. Perhaps the whole province will be greatly affected by the shortage of specialists.
                As a solution, we predict when the nearest hospitals and pharmacies will be informed. The
                system will be updated. All available places will be provided without much fuss.

                <br />
                <br />
                Chronic disorders like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes cause half of all deaths worldwide. 1 in
                4 Americans die from heart disease, and 1 in 5 from cancer. Nevertheless, many people die daily
                because these chronic diseases are not diagnosed early. John Elflein, Statista's health, diseases,
                and medical professionals research expert, estimated that 17.9 million people died from chronic
                diseases worldwide. In the Sri Lanka also have this common problem and most people are dying even without
                knowing the disease. Due to the current economic situation the country people not focus their
                health because medical costs such as doctor channeling, Tests , identifying diseases are very high
                .As well as people don’t have time to go to public hospitals for diagnose the diseases due to there
                are waiting list. So deaths caused by chronic diseases are increased day by day . Therefore
                necessity of chronic diseases prediction system should be in place.

                <br />
                <br />
                Indirect diseases such as diabetics and heart disease cause inactivity and laziness of people. This
                is a direct cause of people's unhealthy lifestyles. According to the WHO, the number of diabetic
                patients increased by 3% between 2000 and 2019. According to the National Diabetes Statistical
                Report in the United States, one in five Americans are unaware they have diabetic, and eight in
                ten are unaware they have pre diabetic. In 2019, the number of individuals with diabetes was 463
                million. According to forecasts, this figure is expected to increase by 578 million by 2030 and is
                projected to reach 700 million by 2045.
                <br />
                <br />
                The most important element of these diseases is that they are treatable with prompt and adequate
                care. People rarely undergo tests to determine whether or not they have chronic conditions such as
                diabetes and heart disease. Lack of cardiologists, endocrinologists, and diabetologists is one of the
                primary reasons behind this. There is instance only one cardiologist, endocrinologist, and
                diabetologist for every three districts.
                <br />
                <br />
                Existing systems do not permit patients to detect diabetes and heart disease using health records
                such as the LIPID profile report or the fasting blood pressure report, as determined by the research
                team. In addition, existing technologies are unable of determining whether a patient's condition is
                critical or not.
                <br />
                <br />
                Another research challenge in this field is the need to create accurate and dependable machine
                learning algorithms for predicting future health outcomes. To be effective at predicting disease
                progression, these algorithms must be trained on large datasets of patient health data. However,
                due to privacy concerns and data-sharing restrictions, obtaining these datasets can be difficult.
                Finally, there is a need to assess the Secure Health Management and Prediction System for
                Chronic Diseases' effectiveness in improving patient outcomes and lowering healthcare costs.
                This necessitates the conduct of clinical trials as well as the collection of data on patient health
                outcomes, treatment costs, and quality of life. Such research will provide valuable insights into
                the potential benefits of this system and will inform future system design and implementation
                improvements.

                to allow users to input relevant data in order to predict individual health insurance-billed
                medical expenses. After that we can monitor the performance of the machine learning
                models in production and make any necessary adjustments to ensure their continued
                accuracy and reliability. Train and validate the model, then build a user-friendly web
                application for personalized health insurance expense forecasts. According to predicted
                insurance cost, system will show the best, available and recommended insurance plan to
                patient. Patient can request that recommended insurance plan and the insurance provider
                login to the system to response those requests

                The aim of this project is to develop a system to identify diabetes and heart disease using
                medical reports for give a prediction to user whether user has chronic diseases or not and
                analyzing the condition of the patient. If patient has diabetes and heart diseases system
                displays doctors, hospitals, pharmacies that nearby to user according to location which
                user provided. As well as system estimates the medical costs that will be covered by a
                certain health insurance plan. Then, we can monitor on how the machine learning
                models are faring in production, where we can make any required updates to keep them
                accurate and predictable
